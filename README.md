## WARNING: Kubeless is no longer actively maintained by VMware.

VMware has made the difficult decision to stop driving this project and therefore we will no longer actively respond to issues or pull requests. If you would like to take over maintaining this project independently from VMware, please let us know so we can add a link to your forked project here.

Thank You.

# Kubeless site

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kubeless/kubeless-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kubeless/kubeless-website)

This repository contains the [kubeless.io](http://kubeless.io) source code. We use [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) to generate the final HTML code.

We recommend you the [middlemant documentation site](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/). There you will find useful tutorials, videos and advanced configuration guides.

## Structure

This project follows the basic structure of `middleman` projects. All the files related to the site generation are located in the `source` folder. In this folder, we can find the following files and folders:

* **assets**: it includes all the files related to the frontend. Here we will place images, styles and javascript files.
* **layouts**: these are the `middleman` layouts. It defines the basic layout for all the pages but you can create new ones if it's required. Also, we use partials to reduce the HAML code in main layout.
* **x.html.md**: All the pages of the site, written in markdown.

To define custom data to inject to the project we can use the `data` folder. It also includes an YAML example file with some links to Bitnami products. You have more information about custom data in the [middleman documentation](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/data-files/).

If you need to add any Ruby code to the project, you can create the files in the `lib` folder. These files will be load automatically by middleman. The middlman documentation includes more information about [helpers](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/helper-methods/) and [external ruby dependencies](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/directory-structure/#lib-directory).

Once we build the project, all the files will be placed in the `build` folder. These files can be served directly in server.

## Configuration

All the middleman configuration is present in the [config.rb file](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless.github.io/blob/master/config.rb). As you can see, the file is very simple. This is intentional because every project is different and it will require a different configuration. The config file only applies the common configuration of all our projects.

## Development

To start the development server execute the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The example site will be available on [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). The domain can change depending on your docker configuration. If you're using docker in a virtual machine, please check the [Docker Machine section](#docker-machine).

All the changes you perform in the `config.rb` file and the `source` folder will be applied directly. Once you reload the page, the changes will appear.

### Docker Machine

If you're running `docker` in a virtual machine, the URL of the project will be [http://VIRTUAL_MACHINE_IP:4567](http://VIRTUAL_MACHINE_IP:4567). Remember to change the `VIRTUAL_MACHINE_IP` placeholder with the IP of your virtual machine.

## Deployment

This project is deployed through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/kubeless/kubeless.github.io) and it uses [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) as hosting. On every commit in `master`, the site is deployed automatically.

## Docs

The documentation pages are generated on the fly when running `middleman`. In the file [`config.rb`](./config.rb) we use the status of the submodule `kubeless-src` for generating the different doc pages.

The files under `kubeless-src/docs/*md` are copied into the `source/docs/` folder adding the `middleman` frontmatter. The folders `kubeless-src/docs/img` and `kubeless-src/docs/misc` are copied as well.

The links for the different documentation pages are manually set in the file `source/layouts/partials/_links.html.haml`.
